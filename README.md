# TIC-TAC-TOE
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players (or a player vs computer, depending on version) to play the game in the terminal/console. The program checks the game board after every move to determine if there is a winner, a draw, or if the game should continue. Tools Used: Python
